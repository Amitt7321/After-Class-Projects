                <h3>Facts About Lions</h3>
                <p>Lions are highly social, apex predators—unique among cats for living in groups called prides—primarily inhabiting
                African grasslands, with a small population in India's Gir Forest. Known for their immense strength, males possess dark manes for protection and dominance, while females do most of the hunting. They are resting for up to 20 hours a day.
